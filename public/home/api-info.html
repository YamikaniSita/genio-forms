		<h1>API's</h1>
		<p>This service provides two public Programming Interfaces enabling customers
		to integrate the data collector to there own applications. All API's are RESTful 
		and can be integrated with any programming language which supports RESTful requests. 
		You need an API access code to use these APIs. If you have none register one <a href='/api/generate' target='_blank'>here</a></p>
		<hr>
		<h1>User Access Control</h1>
		<p>This API allows you to control who can access your forms online, for example allow only
		your system users alone to access a form without sharing an access code.</p>
		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<p>You request via the API for a link for a user this link can only be used once and has an expiry time that you can set
		NB: The form must be secured ie have an access code to use this feature. The API simply bypasses the code.</p>
		<h1>How to use</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Make a request to the API</li>
			<p>Request must be made to the following url {{apiLink}} via POST method contained in the body
			must be the your API key and expiry date following is an example using JQuery</p>

			method: "POST",
			data: {

				expiry: 0.1 //the expiry is set in hours in this example the link expires in 6 minutes
			},
			success: function(result){
				//handle result
				}
			});
			</pre>
		<h1>The Request Response</h1>
		<p>A successful request is an object in the following form</p>

			<h1>Live Data API</h1>

			<h1>How to use</h1>
				<pre>	
					
				<pre>
				<p>Monitor your console for errors or successes. You need to login to your 
				data collector dashboard on the same browser where the lIVE data will be run</p>
				<p>A red button with the 'Live' will mean everything is set and well while a grey one means connection is either in progress or has failed
				if the button is grey check your console for errors</p>
